Project Title: Text-Based RPG with Swing GUI

Description:

Text-Based RPG with Swing GUI is a Java application developed in IntelliJ IDEA, designed as an interactive role-playing game where players engage in turn-based combat against enemies. The game features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Java’s Swing library, replacing traditional console input/output with a windowed experience. Players can create a character by entering their name, view real-time stats (health points), and perform actions like attacking or fleeing via clickable buttons. The game includes a dynamic battle log displayed in a scrollable text area, providing feedback on combat outcomes and events. Core mechanics include randomized damage calculations, a 50% chance to escape combat, and win/lose conditions based on health depletion. Additional features include a reset button to restart the game without closing the application and basic styling for improved visual appeal (e.g., fonts, spacing). The project demonstrates object-oriented programming principles through distinct Player and Enemy classes, encapsulating attributes and behaviors, and leverages IntelliJ’s tools for efficient development, debugging, and refactoring. Designed as a foundational RPG, it offers ample room for expansion—potential enhancements include inventory systems, multiple enemies, and graphical assets—making it an ideal starting point for exploring game development in Java.

Key Features:

GUI-driven gameplay with Swing components (JFrame, JLabel, JButton, JTextArea).
Turn-based combat with randomized damage and escape mechanics.
Real-time stat updates (health) and a battle log for player feedback.
Customizable player name via a dialog prompt at startup.
Reset functionality to replay without restarting the application.
Modular design with potential for adding inventory, levels, or more enemies.

Technologies Used: Java, Swing, IntelliJ IDEA.
